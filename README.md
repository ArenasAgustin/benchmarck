# JavaScript Benchmark Tool

## Description

The JavaScript Benchmark Tool is an interactive web application designed to test and compare the performance of JavaScript code snippets. It allows users to create, run, and analyze multiple test cases to determine their execution speed and efficiency.

## Features

- **Global Variables**: Define global variables that can be used across all test cases.
- **Test Cases**: Add, delete, copy, and clear individual test cases.
- **Performance Chart**: Visualize the performance of each test case with a dynamic bar chart.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use `Ctrl + Enter` to run tests and `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` to add a new test case.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
